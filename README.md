## General Information
- Business Objectives:
  BoomBikes has following business goals -
  - To recover from considerable drop in revenues caused due to Corona pandemic
  - To accelerate revenue by predicting bike demands more accurately
  - Sustain operations by making huge profits
  - Stand out from other service providers
- Requirements:
  1. Identify the variables which are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
  2. Describe how well those variables describe the bike demands.
- Expected Outcome:
  1. Build a linear model that describes the effect of various features on demand for shared bikes.
  2. The linear model that is built, should be interpretable by management and business.
- Steps followed:
  1. Data Understanding
  2. Data Preparation
  3. Model Building
  4. Model Evaluation
- What is the dataset that is being used?
  'day.csv'


## Conclusions
- Overall we have a decent model with R-squared = 0.726 and Adjusted R-Squared = 0.724.
- The demand of bikes is 72% explainable through following data variables:
  1.  Actual temperature
  2.  Time in market (After a year, in 2019, the demand increased than the previous year)
  3.  Clear weather


## Technologies Used
- python 3.x
- pandas
- statsmodels
- Scikit-learn
